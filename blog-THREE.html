                    <p class="mb-30">My love of mechanical things includes driving pretty much anything I can learn to drive. I drive tractors, stick shift cars, aircraft, motorcycles. Motorcycles have become an issue lately. I have ridden for over 40 years without an incident on the road. I road dirt bikes as a teen and learned many skills that seemed useless until one saved my life. I was riding a Ninja 650 that I was converting to a Versys in full safety gear when a SUV ran a stop sign in heavy traffic in front of me. I had nowhere to turn so I grabbed the front brake handle and stood the bike on the front wheel, pivoted 90 degrees and slammed into the the SUV sideways crushing my leg. After falling off the bike I ended up with my helmet under the rear wheel of the SUV. I suffered a concussion, memory loss, vertigo and some nerves were pulled out that control my left arm. My fingers worked but my arm dangled. After all the leg surgeries I had a couple of nerves moved to control my arm. It has taken a year to learn to move my arm in the most basic ways. I can type two handed again but my fingers alternate between being numb and hurting constantly. 
</p>
<p class="mb-30">I have worked in two startups. One building light airplanes and the second a laser wind sensor. We used telecom lasers and detectors to sense the speed and direction of the wind at a distance. I was one of the founders of Blue Scout wind sensing. As the lead engineer and large percentage owner of the company I lead a team of engineers and techs that assisted me in coding, signal processing, installing and maintenance of the sensors. I worked with my systems engineer and customers to update the requirements for both hardware and software to define the next generation sensor. I was able to use CI, DevOps, and Scrum agile that I had learned woking at AMD as a developer.
</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I have a degree in art (Industrial Design) and a Masters in Aeronautical engineering. This means that in addition to being able to invent things and make them work I am aware that the way things appear can affect the target user. I tend to learn things vertically. I am a pilot of powered and soaring aircraft, I maintain, modify and build parts for the aircraft that I fly. I have a degree in aeronautical engineering where I have worked in analysis, and optimization of fly-by-wire aircraft. I have designed and coded numerous flight simulators to run analysis and real time pilot-in-the-loop virtual flying. I have designed and coded numerous embedded avionics (aircraft electronics) instruments, navigation, sensors and displays.
</p>
<p class="mb-30">Since avionics and simulators require computers, hardware and applications I learned to code embedded systems. I had an interest in 3d computer graphics as a teen and learned to code in C on a IBM PC which required becoming saturated in techniques to optimize code for speed. 3d graphics involves using linear algebra to perform transformation (rotation, translation and scaling) and projection to display on a 2d screen. Aeronautical engineering expanded my applied mathematics in navigation, simulation, handling qualities, theoretical and computational aerodynamics. 
</p> 
<p class="mb-30">
Working with real time systems forces a developer to explore operating systems since we have to set up the RTOS, customize the BSP for the specific system and sometimes configure whole systems such as the Flash memory, PCI bus or OpenGL graphics. Reading specs like the PCI bus and OpenGL provide in-depth understanding of drivers. Working on OpenGL drivers for a GPU expanded knowledge of the internals of drivers and some of the inner workings of Windows. Working with the audio system in windows including various and busses cores on the SOC die included SOC core development and understanding of SOC data movement including DMA and memory busses.
</p> 
<p class="mb-30">working in the Silicon Valley encouraged me to learn algorithms which I discovered are almost mandatory to get performance on a microcontoller.
